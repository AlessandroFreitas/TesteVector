# TesteVector (developed by Alessandro Dias)

TesteVector is an API created with the purpose of consuming a list of users' emails, providing an endpoint that shows a grouped view of the emails in an array, and one that shows a grouped view of the emails by the hour part of the "createdAt" attribute.

It also provides authentication endpoints, where you can register an user and login, to generate a bearer token using JWT.
